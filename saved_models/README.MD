This folder is needed to save and load models.

If you want to use one of the pretrained models in the subfolder, simply uncompress the *.7z* file to get the needed *.tar* file, which can be loaded by PyTorch. The compression was needed to upload the files on Github, since the models saved by PyTorch are large than 100MB (file size limit of Github).
